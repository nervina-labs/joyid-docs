Understanding the difference between a `challenge` and a `message`.

A `challenge` is what you as a developer need JoyID to sign.
A `message` is the piece of data that JoyID actually signs. A `message` is a combination of a `challenge` and some other data needed to complete the process, such as authenticator data, etc. The `challenge` is always included within the `message`.

For more information, you can check out the [WebAuthn Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-op-get-assertion).
