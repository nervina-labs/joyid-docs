# Login With Lightning

JoyID supports Login with Lightning, letting users sign into your app securely using the Lightning Network. This feature uses the [LNURL-auth](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/legacy/lnurl-auth.md) protocol and allows login via a Lightning wallet like Alby or Zeus, without passwords.
To implement this, follow the LNURL-auth flow: https://lightninglogin.live .
